# TetrisDS
This game was made during my last year of Bachelor's degree, using Java and JavaFX.
As its name indicates, it is based on the DS version of the famous game __Tetris__, and offers two modes : Standard and Push.

The first mode is just the standard version of Tetris, which was created decades ago.

The second mode allows two players to play together, where the goal is to make the other player lose by pushing the limit of their area.
